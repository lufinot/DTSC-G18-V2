    "Forest fires are a disaster that harms both the environment and the economy through the damage that they cause to our planet. Algeria is known to be one of the many countries that have been greatly affected by forest fires. The data set Algerian Forest Fires from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Algerian+Forest+Fires+Dataset++) contains attributes that were collected to determine the probability of forest fires occurring from many different factors. We are trying to answer whether or not fires can be accurately predicted by using a k-nearest neighbors classification on factors such as rain, wind speed, temperature, and humidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set contains information about forest fires in two regions of Algeria, the Bejaia region that is located in the Northeast of Algeria, and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the Northwest of Algeria, both of these regions are combined together into one data set. We will be using the Bejaia region within this project. The data set includes 11 attributes and 1 output attribute (class). The attributes within this data set are: Day, Month, Year, Temperature, Relative Humidity (RH), Wind Speed (WS), Rain, Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), Duff Moisutre Code (DMC), Drought Code (DC), Initial Spread Index (ISI), Buildup Index (BUI), and Fire Weather Index (FWI) components. \n"

We chose these attributes because we think these will be the most useful in helping us predict fires. We will report the results with graphs showing whether or not there is a strong relationship between the different factors and whether or not there will be a fire, as well as an accuracy % for our classification model."
